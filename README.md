# Connect Tech Workshop Labs
The purpose of this repo is to provide labs to introduce a user to the wide
world of emerging tech we find fun. Labs include Actions on Google,
Facebook Messenger Chatbots, and Intros to many others(WebAr, WebVr, Web Speech
API, IoT).

Check out the individual folders to find READMEs for each lab. All labs are
built using javascript.

## Schedule:
- 1-2:30 - Actions on Google (VUI/CUI, API.AI, Firebase, ways to build)
- 2:30-4 - Facebook Messenger Bots (Facebook Messenger, Wit.ai)
- 4-5 - WebAr, Web Speech API, WebVr, IoT (A-Frame, AR.js, Web Speech API)

_Note: This is the rough schedule, we will move as a group, but feel free to work
on what inspires you from this list!_
