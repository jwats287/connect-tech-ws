# Web AR Example
If you haven't already, checkout [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). While this is
used for VR specifically, [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/ar.js) is a
Web AR library that can be used on top of A-Frame.


## To run:
1. Open the index.html file in Chrome.
2. If prompted, allow access to your webcam.
2. Hold up the Hiro marker so your webcam can see it.
3. You should see a cube appear on top of the Hiro marker.
