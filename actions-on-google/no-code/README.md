# API.AI - No Webhook
The purpose of this example is to show a way to build an Action without a
webhook using [api.ai](api.ai) for voice interactions. This can be used on a
Google Assistant app, a Google Home device, and/or the Actions on Google web
simulator.

## To run this project:
1. Create a new api.ai project and upload the zip file to the project.
2. Under fulfillment, enable Actions on Google.
3. Test in the Actions on Google web simulator + devices.

_Note: This project is for demonstration purposes and is not intended for production use._
